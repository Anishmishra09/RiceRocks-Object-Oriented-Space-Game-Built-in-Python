# Asteroid Survival: A Python Space Shooter Game

**Asteroid Survival** is a 2D arcade-style space shooter game developed in Python using the SimpleGUI library. Inspired by the classic game *Asteroids*, this project demonstrates key programming concepts like object-oriented design, real-time animation, and interactive GUI development. Players control a spaceship to dodge and destroy incoming asteroids using missiles, aiming for the highest score while managing limited lives.

## Features

- Spaceship with thrust, rotation, and shooting controls  
- Random asteroid spawning with dynamic velocity and angle  
- Missile launching with sound effects and collision detection  
- Animated explosions using sprite sheets  
- Real-time score and lives tracking  
- Game reset mechanism with splash screen  
- Background animation and full sound integration

## Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Thrust forward  
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Rotate the ship  
- **Space Bar**: Shoot missiles  
- **Mouse Click**: Start or restart the game via splash screen

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- SimpleGUI (CodeSkulptor framework)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Real-time GUI and event handling  
- Sprite animation and audio integration  
- Collision detection and game loop logic

## How the Game Works

1. The game begins with a splash screen and background music.
2. Clicking the screen starts the game with the ship at the center.
3. Asteroids spawn randomly, avoiding the ship's initial location.
4. Players rotate and thrust the ship using arrow keys and fire missiles with the spacebar.
5. Missiles that collide with asteroids destroy them and increase the score.
6. Collisions between asteroids and the ship reduce lives.
7. When lives reach zero, the game stops and returns to the splash screen, allowing restart.

## Learning Outcomes

- Applying object-oriented programming to game development  
- Designing real-time interactive applications in Python  
- Implementing collision detection and object lifecycles  
- Managing user input, animations, and sprite groups  
- Integrating sound, images, and GUI logic in a cohesive program  
- Writing modular, maintainable, and extensible game code

## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels or increasing asteroid speed  
- Introduce power-ups or shields  
- Implement a health bar and boss battles  
- Add persistent high score tracking  
- Port the game using Pygame or web frameworks like Pygame.js
